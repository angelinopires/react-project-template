# React workflow

This workflow was created based on my personal experience. It's an alternative to `create-react-app`, therefore it's more flexible.
## 💻 Stack

- React
- SCSS
- Webpack 5

## 📋 Requirements
- Node v14.17.3 or similar

## 👨‍💻 Setup

1. Clone the Project
2. If you're using `nvm`, run these commands before proceeding
```bash
$ nvm install 14.17.3
$ nvm use
```
3. Then, install the packages
```bash
$ npm install
```
OR
```
$ yarn
```
4. After finished, run in development mode
```bash
$ npm run dev
```
OR
```
$ yarn dev
```

### Enjoy!
